2. Configure AWS credentials using one of these methods:

   - AWS CLI: `aws configure`
   - Environment variables:

     export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"
     ```
   - IAM role (if running on AWS infrastructure)

3. Run the executable and follow the interactive prompts

### Option 2: Build from Source

#### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or later
- AWS credentials configured
- Required AWS permissions:
  - S3: CreateBucket, PutObject, PutBucketPolicy
  - CloudFront: CreateDistribution, CreateOriginAccessControl
  - IAM: GetUser

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youssefframy/aws-deploy-static-site.git
cd aws-deploy-static-site
```

2. Build the project:

```

## Usage Guide

The tool provides an interactive CLI interface that will guide you through the deployment process:

1. Select deployment type:

   - Static Website (Basic)
   - Single Page Application (SPA)

2. Configure deployment settings:

   - AWS Profile (optional)
   - S3 Bucket Name
   - Website Files Location
   - CloudFront Distribution Description
   - AWS Region

3. Wait for deployment completion (typically 10-15 minutes for CloudFront propagation)

## Architecture

The deployment process:

1. Creates a private S3 bucket
2. Configures website hosting settings
3. Uploads your static files with optimal caching headers
4. Creates a CloudFront distribution with Origin Access Control
5. Configures security policies and routing rules

## Security Features

- ‚úÖ Private S3 bucket with public access blocked
- ‚úÖ CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)
- ‚úÖ HTTPS-only access
- ‚úÖ Secure IAM policies
- ‚úÖ Custom error handling for SPAs

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Access Denied**

   - Verify AWS credentials are configured correctly
   - Ensure IAM user has required permissions

2. **Bucket Creation Failed**

   - Check if bucket name is globally unique
   - Verify selected region supports all services

3. **Upload Issues**

   - Confirm website folder path is correct
   - Check file permissions

4. **CloudFront Errors**
   - Allow 10-15 minutes for distribution deployment
   - Verify domain name resolution
